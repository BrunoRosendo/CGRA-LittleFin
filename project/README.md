## Project Notes

- For the fish's body texture, we used the following image:
```https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pt/view-image.php?image=283612&picture=fundo-de-padrao-de-escalas-de-peixe```
- For the pillars' texture, we used the following image:
```https://snappygoat.com/s/?q=bestof%3Atrunk+tree+wood+nature+tree+bark+bark+texture+branch```
- We added an extra skybox (mountain), using the following cube map:
```https://www.nicepng.com/ourpic/u2q8o0t4i1w7q8y3_desert-skybox-texture-png/```
- Regarding the water surface (exercise 5.2), instead of moving the image without taking the position of the pier into considerantion, we vary the texture's position slightly so it's always close to it, resulting in a more realistic scene.
